    The Demand constraint drives the model.  This constraint ensures that supply
    meets the demand specified by the Demand parameter in all periods,

    :math:`C^d` set is distinct from both :math:`C^e` and :math:`C^p`. In other
    words, an end-use demand must only be an end-use demand.  Note that if an output

    For end-use demands, it is unreasonable to let the model arbitrarily shift the
    use of demand technologies across time slices. For instance, if household A buys
    a natural gas furnace while household B buys an electric furnace, then both units
    should be used throughout the year.  Without this constraint, the model might choose
    to only use the electric furnace during the day, and the natural gas furnace during the
    night.

    This constraint ensures that the ratio of a process activity to demand is
    constant for all time slices. In other words, while the model may choose how
    each technology contributes to a demand at the annual level, the time slice
    level distribution of the technology's contribution to the demand is fixed to
    the demand specific distribution.

    Where the Demand constraint :eq:`Demand` ensures that end-use demands are met,
    the CommodityBalance constraint ensures that the endogenous system demands are
    met.  This constraint requires the total production of a given commodity
    to equal the amount consumed, thus ensuring an energy balance at the system
    level. In this most general form of the constraint, the energy commodity being
    balanced has variable production at the time slice level. The energy commodity
    can then be consumed by three types of processes: storage technologies, non-storage
    technologies with output that varies at the time slice level, and non-storage
    technologies with constant annual output.

    Separate expressions are required in order to account for the consumption of
    commodity :math:`c` by downstream processes. For the commodity flow into storage
    technologies, we use :math:`\textbf{FI}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`. Note that the FlowIn
    variable is defined only for storage technologies, and is required because storage
    technologies balance production and consumption across time slices rather than
    within a single time slice. For commodity flows into non-storage processes with time
    varying output, we use :math:`\textbf{FO}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}/EFF_{r, i,t,v,o}`.
    The division by :math:`EFF_{r, c,t,v,o}` is applied to the output flows that consume
    commodity :math:`c` to determine input flows. Finally, we need to account
    for the consumption of commodity :math:`c` by the processes in
    :code:`tech_annual`. Since the commodity flow of these processes is on an
    annual basis, we use :math:`SEG_{s,d}` to calculate the consumption of
    commodity :math:`c` in time-slice :math:`(s,d)` from the annual flows.
    Formulating an expression for the production of commodity :math:`c` is
    more straightforward, and is simply calculated by
    :math:`\textbf{FO}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`.

    In some cases, the overproduction of a commodity may be required, such
    that the supply exceeds the endogenous demand. Refineries represent a
    common example, where the share of different refined products are governed
    by TechOutputSplit, but total production is driven by a particular commodity
    like gasoline. Such a situation can result in the overproduction of other
    refined products, such as diesel or kerosene. In such cases, we need to
    track the excess production of these commodities. To do so, the technology
    producing the excess commodity should be added to the :code:`tech_flex` set.
    This flexible technology designation will activate a slack variable
    (:math:`\textbf{FLX}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`) representing
    the excess production in the :code:`CommodityBalanceAnnual_constraint`. Note
    that the :code:`tech_flex` set is different from :code:`tech_curtailment` set;
    the latter is technology- rather than commodity-focused and is used in the
    :code:`Capacity_constraint` to track output that is used to produce useful
    output and the amount curtailed, and to ensure that the installed capacity
    covers both. Alternatively, the commodity can be added to the
    :code:`commodity_waste` set, for which this equality constraint becomes an
    inequality constraint, allowing production to exceed consumption for a single
    commodity.

    This constraint also accounts for imports and exports between regions
    when solving multi-regional systems. The import (:math:`\textbf{FIM}`) and export
    (:math:`\textbf{FEX}`) variables are created on-the-fly by summing the
    :math:`\textbf{FO}` variables over the appropriate import and export regions,
    respectively, which are defined in :code:`temoa_initialize.py` by parsing the
    :code:`tech_exchange` processes.

    Consumption of the commodity by construction inputs is annualised using the period
    length. Production of the commodity by end-of-life outputs uses the AnnualRetirement
    variable, which is already annualised.

    Finally, for annual commodities, AnnualCommodityBalance is used which balances
    the sum of flows over each year.

    exports + flex waste*
