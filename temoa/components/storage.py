    This constraint ensures that the amount of energy stored does not exceed
    the upper bound set by the energy capacity of the storage device, as calculated
    on the right-hand side.

    Because the number and duration of time slices are user-defined, we need to adjust
    the storage duration, which is specified in hours. First, the hourly duration is divided
    by the number of hours in a year to obtain the duration as a fraction of the year.
    Since the :math:`C2A` parameter assumes the conversion of capacity to annual activity,
    we need to express the storage duration as fraction of a year. Then, :math:`SEG_{s,d}`
    summed over the time-of-day slices (:math:`d`) multiplied by :math:`DPP` yields the
    number of days per season. This step is necessary because conventional time sliced models
    use a single day to represent many days within a given season. Thus, it is necessary to
    scale the storage duration to account for the number of days in each season.

    Unlike non-seasonal (daily) storage, seasonal storage is allowed to carry energy
    between seasons. However, through seasons representing multiple days, many days'
    charge deltas have accumulated, multiplied by the number of days the season
    represents. If we allowed these stacked deltas to carry between seasons then we would
    be multiplying the effective energy capacity of the storage. We could just constrain
    the seasonal delta to the unadjusted energy capacity, but then the final day in the
    season would sit atop a season's worth of deltas, possibly exceeding our upper or
    lower bound by a factor of :math:`\frac{N-1}{N}` where :math:`N` is the number of
    days the sequential season represents.

        The energy upper bound or non-negative lower bound could be violated in a
        season representing multiple days if we both adjusted the upper bound to
        the number of days and allowed a seasonal delta.

    So, we do not adjust the upper energy bound for seasonal storage. This limits the
    ability of seasonal storage to perform arbitrage within each season, but allows it to
    carry energy between seasons realistically.

    This constraint is used if the users wishes to force a specific storage charge level
    for certain storage technologies and vintages at a certain time slice. User-specified
    storage charge levels that are sufficiently different from the optimal could impact the
    cost-effectiveness of storage.

    :code:`s` can be a season from the :code:`time_season` set or a sequential season from
    the :code:`time_sequential_season` set.
