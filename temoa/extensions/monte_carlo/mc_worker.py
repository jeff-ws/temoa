"""

Class to contain Workers that execute solves in separate processes

dev note:
This class is derived from the original Worker class in MGA extension, but is just different enough
that it is a separate class.  In future, it may make sense to re-combine these.  RN, this worker
will ingest DataPortal objects to make new models.  The MGA will (in future) likely just take in
new obj functions
