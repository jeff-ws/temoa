Installing Software Elements
----------------------------

Temoa is implemented in `Pyomo <https://www.pyomo.org/>`_, which is in turn
written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_. Consequently, Temoa will run on
Linux, Mac, Windows, or any operating system that Pyomo supports. There are
several open source software elements required to run Temoa.

**Using pip**:

The standard way to install Temoa:

First, it is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:

.. parsed-literal::
  # Linux / macOS
  $ python -m venv temoa_env
  $ source temoa_env/bin/activate

  # Windows (Command Prompt)
  > python -m venv temoa_env
  > temoa_env\\Scripts\\activate

  # Windows (PowerShell)
  PS> python -m venv temoa_env
  PS> .\\temoa_env\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

Then, install Temoa:

.. parsed-literal::
  # Install from PyPI
  $ pip install temoa

  # Get started
  $ temoa tutorial
  $ temoa run tutorial_config.toml

**Using uv (Alternative)**:

For faster dependency resolution:

.. parsed-literal::
  # Install uv (Linux / macOS)
  $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

  # Install uv (Windows)
  PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

  # Create a uv initialized virtual environment
  $ uv init <dir_name>
  $ cd <dir_name>

  # add Temoa from PyPI to pyproject.toml
  $ uv add temoa

  # Get started
  $ uv run temoa tutorial
  $ uv run temoa run tutorial_config.toml

**For Contributors (Development Installation)**:

If you want to contribute to Temoa or modify the code:

.. parsed-literal::
  # Clone the repository
  $ git clone https://github.com/TemoaProject/temoa.git
  $ cd temoa

  # Install in development mode with uv (recommended)
  $ uv sync --all-extras --dev

  # Install pre-commit hooks
  $ uv run pre-commit install

For detailed contribution guidelines, see CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository.

Solvers
-------

A few notes for on the choice of solvers. Different solvers
have widely varying solution times. If you plan to run Temoa with large datasets
and/or conduct uncertainty analysis, you may want to consider installing
commercial linear solvers such as `CPLEX
<https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer>`_ or `Gurobi
<https://www.gurobi.com/>`_. Both offer free academic licenses.

For smaller models, Temoa has been tested with the `HiGHS <https://pypi.org/project/highspy/>`_
solver. HiGHS is automatically available when you install Temoa and requires no additional setup.


Running Temoa
-------------

To run the model, a configuration (``config``) file is needed. While an
example config file called :code:`config_sample.toml` is available as a package resource
in :code:`temoa/tutorial_assets`, it is not directly runnable on its own. The tutorial
flow also generates the SQLite database and copies :code:`mc_settings.csv` alongside it.
Users should follow the **temoa tutorial** command (see below) to obtain a fully runnable
setup. Running the model with a config file allows
the user to (1) use a sqlite database for storing input and output data, (2)
create a formatted Excel output file, (2) specify the solver to use, (3) return
the log file produced during model execution, (4) return the lp file utilized by
the solver, and (5) to execute several of the modeling extensions.

.. parsed-literal::
  $ temoa run tutorial_config.toml

**For general help, use --help:**

.. parsed-literal::
  $ **temoa --help**

    To supplement this documentation, we have also created a
    `YouTube video tutorial <https://youtu.be/WtzCrroAXnQ>` that explains
    how to run Temoa from the command line. There is also an option to run
    `Temoa on the cloud <https://model.temoacloud.com>`, which
    is explained in `this video tutorial <https://youtu.be/fxYO_kIs364>`.
